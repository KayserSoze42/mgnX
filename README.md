AI models for identifying wild mushrooms located in Central Europe, primarily in Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Project built upon PyTorch foundations using the basics of CNN techniques and practices, enriching the dataset with geolocation and weather data.

--------------------------------------

tl;dr or idk:


- LWM

    + "first draft" model utilizing smaller dataset, aimed for decent identification
            
    + designed for easy integration with a mobile app


- LLWM

    + "second draft" model utilizing larger dataset, aimed for improved identification

    + advanced model that sits on the backend server

- L3WM

    + woah there.. 

    + EZ noe

---------------------------------------

what future brings?

- Data collection

- Data preparation

- Model modelling

- Simple predictions

- idk
